Berlin-A-to-Z
=============

**Using phone-directories to map intra-city migration patterns**  
A project by Patrick Stotz & Achim Tack. Published in 01/2014 on [mappable.info](http://mappable.info)

This is a visualization of approx 50.000 individual intra-city relocations in the city of Berlin during the years 2004 and 2012.
The data for the visualization was derived from digitized phone directories. Part of the interactive's code, written in D3/Javascript was inspired by Christoph Ingraham's visualization of [US State Migration Flows](http://wonkviz.tumblr.com/post/68197449379/state-migration-flows-2012).
